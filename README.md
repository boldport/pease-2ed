![Pease circuit board image](/images/pease.jpg)

This kit is the very first Boldport Club project. It's a tribute to Bob Pease, a legendary analogue designer, with the circuit based around the LM331, 'voltage to frequency converter' that he designed. All the components for the circuit in Figure 20 of the datasheet: light intensity to frequency converter are provided. Alternatively, surface-mount components can be used (not provided in the kit).
